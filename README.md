# ASU Spec2Tapeout ICLAD 2025 Hackathon Problems

## Infrastructure setup

If you are participating in the SLM category: 
The prerequisites are iVerilog and OpenROAD-flow-scripts that should be available on your laptops. For SLM problems, you will not be evaluated on hidden testcases!

If you are participating in the LLM category:
Solving these problems requires the Docker image already available in your GCP VM instance. You can run the docker image as follows to create an environment that has OpenROAD-flow-scripts and iVerilog already installed:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/iclad_hackathon:/workspace/iclad_hackathon \
  iclad_hackathon:latest bash
```

## Problem Set

Your objective is to design tapeout-ready ASICs based on the given problem specifications in the yaml format described below. For each problem, you must develop an LLM agent script/tool that produces the following output files:

## Required Outputs

- Synthesizable RTL in SystemVerilog  
- Constraint files in SDC format  
- Tapeout-ready OpenROAD DB (ODB), i.e., 6_final.odb generated by ORFS

## Guidelines

- Module signatures are provided for each problem. Your generated RTL must **strictly follow** these signatures to ensure compatibility with automated test frameworks.  
- Your LLM agent script/tool should **generalize to unseen/hidden problems**, which will be provided in a similar format.  
- Please provide solutions for **all** the questions, even if your script does not generalize to other testcases.  

## Hints

- You have access to **iVerilog**. Use it iteratively with your LLM to verify the functional correctness of your code.  
- You must generate your own **testbenches** to validate RTL functionality (use of LLMs allowed). We have our own testbenches that we will use to evaluate your RTL. However, we will not be releasing this. Its your goal to get your LLM to generate the testbench and verify th RTL. 
- Once your RTL is verified, use **OpenROAD-flow-scripts** to generate the tapeout-ready database and other physical design files and reports.  
- You can use LLMs to learn how to work with ORFS and use the LLM to write a script to integrate your design into the existing ORFS framework.  
- The provided constraints or specifications of frequency are relatively relaxed and should be met without requiring multiple iterations of physical design.

## Example: YAML Spect for Sequence Detector Design for `0011`



```yaml
seq_detector_0011:
  description: Detects a binary sequence "0011" in the input stream.
  tech_node: SkyWater 130HD
  clock_period: 1.1ns
  ports:
    - name: clk
      direction: input
      type: logic
      description: Clock input
    - name: reset
      direction: input
      type: logic
      description: Synchronous reset (active high)
    - name: data_in
      direction: input
      type: logic
      description: Serial data input
    - name: detected
      direction: output
      type: logic
      description: Asserted high for one cycle when '0011' is detected.
  module_signature: |
    module seq_detector_0011(
        input clk,
        input reset,
        input data_in,
        output reg detected
    );
  sequence_to_detect: '0011'

  sample_output: '0000010001000000'
